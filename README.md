# sephora-recommendation

This project is a recommendation model and streamlit web app based on scraped Sephora reviews. The model uses skin type, skin tone and price points as features to predict a user's potential rating. Future plans to expand this include creating a web based "dupe" tool that can allow users to search a skin care product and suggest similar products at lower price points. I also plan to update the UI in Streamlit :)
